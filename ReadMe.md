This is a word classification project.
The project is done using 1020 audio files here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uNPiOeo2vaZ29iGPybJEeWtgt4QOTE6o?usp=sharing

steps of the project:
1. The audio files are releted to 255 people and 4 paragraphs that each indivisual reads the all paragraphs. the first step was to create the audio files for classification. so in order to create the files we had to clip the audios and cut the parts which the speaker was spelling those words. For this purpose we could use 'Praat' or 'Wavepad'
